DrawingApp and RobotProject projects:

Both applications are part of my Master Thesis. The thesis aimed to investigate the capabilities of Lego NXT robots. The objective was to explore the NXT potentials by designing an autonomous robot, able to interact with a user via the computer and perform a number of tasks. It was about a combination of Graphical User Interface designing and Robot Programming, using the JAVA programming language. The drawingApp is a GUI application that allows the user select specific positions into a virtual 10X10 grid. The RobotApp is a LeJOS application that is uploaded to the NXT robot. Once the robot recieves the information from the GUI it will start building the specified pattern.
